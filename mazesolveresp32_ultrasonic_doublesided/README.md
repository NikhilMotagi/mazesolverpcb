This version of pcb has no component changes. A new thing that we tried was to design and fabricate a double sided pcb .
Points to be remebered are 
1) Keep the track width more than 1mm because these are not easy to DIY.
2) Remember to provide appropriate diameter vias when needed, professionally manufactured pcbs have revets that join both bottom and top layers.
