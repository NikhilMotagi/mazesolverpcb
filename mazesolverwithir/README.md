The design inculdes stm32 microcontroller aka sasta controller, IR sensors, L9110s Motor driver, N20 encoder motors, MPU6050.

Working -
IR sensors are set to give signal for a certain distance. MPU is used to get angle of rotation for precise 90 degree turns. Encoder motors help in counting how far the 
bot has travelled 

STM32 is prefered because of it's high operation speed and comparatively good storage.
